# DS-110_Project
This is the final project assignment that my group and I did for DS 110.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert/data

For our final, my team and I were tasked with finding a publicly available dataset and extract meaningful information to detect a pattern in the dataset. We decided on analyzing the 911 dataset because since coming to Boston University, we have heard frequent amublance sirens especially at night. This prompted to investigate a 911 data set and learn as much information as we could from this project.

In this project, I gained a better understanding of how to analayze a dataset with machine learning. The biggest challenge was the size of the dataset. This led to longer wait times to process the data. Overall, this was a great introduction project in getting me started with data science.
